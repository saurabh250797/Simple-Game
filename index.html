            <p>WELCOME TO GUESS ME!</p>
            <p>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.</p>
            <p>If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD.</p>
            <p>If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM.</p>
            <p>If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER.</p>
            <p>If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER.</p>
            <p>LET'S PLAY!</p>
